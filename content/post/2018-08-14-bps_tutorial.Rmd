## Overview

In this post, I am going to look at predicting the number of bonus points that a player will accrue throughout the 2017/18 FPL season. During a fixture, a footballer will receive `bps` points for events e.g. scoring a goal or making an interception. The scoring system for these points can be found at: <https://www.premierleague.com/news/106533>. At the end of the fixture the three players with the highest `bps` values score `bonus` points of (3, 2, 1) respectively, which are added to their total score. I'm going to have a look at the distributions of `bps` scores by position and teams, to get predictions for `bonus` points.

Data was extracted and cleaned from the repository <https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League> for the 2017/18 season.

## Data Exploration

### Setup
Data is stored in my GitHub repository `fpl-analytics`. This is stored as a package and can be installed below.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jphelps13/fpl.analytics")
```

For this tutorial please make sure you have installed the following packages.
I will be using the `data.table` package extensibvely.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Github
library(fpl.analytics)

# CRAN
library(data.table) # data management
library(ggplot2) # plotting tool
library(ggrepel) # plotting tool
library(stringi) # removing special characters from names
library(HH) # glm prediction intervals
```

### Data collection
Some manipulation is required from the raw data to get a view of the players fixture data for the 2017-18 season. A view of the complete data set is below. 

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
# collects the data from fpl.analytics for the vignette
# special characters in player names have been translated to english for ease of use
# with the stringi package
dt <- fpl.analytics::fpl_2017_18_player_history
head(dt, 2)

# trim fixtures where no playing time or bps values
dt <- dt[bps > 0,]
dt <- dt[minutes > 0,] 
```
Most of this data isn't going to be used for this analysis. Key columns are:

* `player_name:` name of footballer, with first name and surname separated with an underscore
* `team/opponent_team:` team in which the footballer plays for, and against for the fixture
* `bps:` number of hidden bonus points the footballer received in a given fixture, based on the bps rules
* `bonus:` the end result bonus score of (1, 2, 3) based on how the footballer performed against the other players (bps)
* `position:` position on the pitch: (GKP, DEF, MID, FWD)
* `was_home:` whether it is a home match for that footballer

The objective is to predict `bonus` from `bps` plus other variables.

### Data Visualisation
Lets have a look at the distribution of `bps` by position. As we go down the pitch, from Goalkeeper to Forward, we see that the Median `bps` value decreases, whilst the upper tail of the distribution increases.
```{r}
# upper bound for bps, will use for plots
qu <- quantile(dt$bps, 0.995)

# check bps by position 
# - Forwards distribution looks bi-modal, with either a low score, or a score ~ 30.
#   Variance is the largest with the longest tail. 
# - Goalkeepers have the highest median, but the shortest tail.  
ggplot() + geom_density(data = dt, aes(x = bps, group = position, fill = position),
               alpha = 0.4, colour = NA, adjust = 1.5) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, qu))
```


Across the season, we can visualise the distribution of the final `bonus` points. I've summed these up by players. 
```{r, warning = FALSE}
sum_dt <- dt[bonus > 0, .(bonus = sum(bonus)), by = .(player_name, team, position)]

# visualise distributions of final bonus points by position and team. 
ggplot() + geom_density(data = sum_dt, aes(x = bonus, group = position, fill = position),
                        alpha = 0.4, colour = NA, adjust = 1.5) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 0.1))
```
Here we see that the heavy right tail for Forwards with regards to `bps` mean they tend to score higher
with final bonus points. The distributions for Midfielders and Defenders are 
very similar, despite Defenders receiving more `bps` on average. This is to be
expected as we are interested in players receiving the most `bps` points each
fixture, not the average.

We can have a look at the `bps` positional split by team:
```{r, dpi = 300, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 12}
# visualise distributions of bps_match by position and team. 
ggplot() + geom_density(data = dt, aes(x = bps, group = position, fill = position),
               alpha = 0.3, adjust = 1.5, colour = NA) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  facet_wrap(~team, ncol = 4) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, qu), ylim = c(0, 0.05))
```

The distribution that differs the most is that for Forwards. The established top 6 teams 
in 2017-18 were (Man City, Man Utd, Spurs, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal). In
all these cases, the distribution of bps is quite long and flat. Compared to the three
relegated teams (Stoke, Swansea, West Brom), there are much larker peaks close 
to 0. 

For Goalkeepers, can see that those at Stoke, Burnley and West Ham do better 
than in other positions.

Looking at the bps scoring system, the highest two valued are "Forwards scoring 
a goal" & "Midfielders" scoring a goal at 24 & 18 respectively. 
Distribution of goals per match are below, scaled and weighted. 
We would expect that when a Forward scores, the likelihood of
receiving bonus points goes up a lot, compared to matches where they don't score.
Assists are worth 9 points, whilst clean sheets for GKP & DEF are worth 12.

```{r, dpi = 300, warning = FALSE}
sum_dt <- dt[, .(goals_scored = sum(goals_scored),
                 assists = sum(assists),
                 clean_sheets = sum(clean_sheets),
                 game_time = sum(minutes)/90), by = .(player_name, position, team)]

sum_dt[, goals_match := goals_scored/game_time]
sum_dt[, assists_match := assists/game_time]
sum_dt[, clean_sheets_match := clean_sheets/game_time]

# goals density, per match
ggplot() + geom_density(data = sum_dt[position != "GKP",], 
                        aes(x = goals_match, fill = position, weight = game_time, y = ..scaled..),
                        alpha = 0.3, colour = NA) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1))

# assists density, per match
ggplot() + geom_density(data = sum_dt[position != "GKP",], 
                        aes(x = assists_match, fill = position, weight = game_time, y = ..scaled..),
                        alpha = 0.3, colour = NA) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1))

# clean sheets density, per match
ggplot() + geom_density(data = sum_dt[!position %in% c("MID", "FWD"),], 
                        aes(x = clean_sheets_match, weight = game_time), fill = "darkgrey", col = NA) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1))
```


## Modelling

### Objective
To predict final match day `bonus` points.

A complete model would consider:
* Fixtures & Home/Away effect e.g.quality of play in different circumstances
* Quality of the team e.g. threshold required for receiving bonus points
* Style of play e.g. Defensive or attacking; Formation
* Exposure i.e. amount of game time per match; number of starts
* Position. bps point system is positional dependent. Correlation of bps between position
* Transfers, team roster, injuries etc. understanding when a player has low exposure

Here is a view of the jittered bps v bonus across all players:

```{r}
ggplot(dt, aes(x = bps, y = bonus)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.5, height= 0.2, col = "darkgrey")
```

This could be converted so that the response is a (0,1) fraction e.g. below.
If this were a binomial problem i.e. bonus points are either 0 or 1, we could
use logistic regression with binary response. For cases such as these, logistic regression is still possible when we use a quasi-likelihood distribution. This allows for the added variance
in the response we have by having multiple levels of bonus points.
```{r}
# max bonus is 3
dt[, bonus_frac := bonus/3]
```

### Logistic regression

#### bps
To make the displays a bit nicer, I'm going to make an assumption that there
is a minimum `bps` threshold required in order to get bonus points. In last years
data, there wasn't a bonus point gained for cases where `bps <= 17`.
I've taken these out, and will assume that their fit is 0. It doesn't affect the 
analysis too much, and allows me to focus the graphs better.

```{r}
# assume that 18 required in order to get a bonus point
min(dt[bonus > 0, bps])
ql <- min(dt[bonus > 0, bps]) - 1
mdt <- dt[bps > ql,]
```

```{r}
# fit base model against bps
mod0 <- glm(bonus_frac ~ bps, data = mdt, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
summary(mod0)

# function to add latest fits to the data, removing any that exist
joinModelDt <- function(mdt, mod_fits){
  suppressWarnings(mdt[, (names(mod_fits)) := NULL])
  return(cbind(mdt, mod_fits))
}
mod0_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod0, type = "response"))
mdt <- joinModelDt(mdt, mod0_fits)

# visualise the output
ggplot(mdt, aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height= 0.025, col = "darkgrey") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi), fill = "orange", colour=NA, alpha = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu))

```
I'm not sure about the prediction intervals from the package `HH`, but this is a 
different topic, not of focus in this post. It looks like it under predicts cases
where `bonus = 3`. There isn't a clear single relationship for bps v bonus. This
makes sense as each fixture differs e.g. number of goals, clean sheets etc.

#### Playing Team
Lets add in random slope and intercept parameters by team. A team that generally
scores more `bps` values, like Man City, will require a higher threshold to receive
bonus points. A low scoring team may require fewer points for a player to out rank
the others in their team e.g. West Brom.

```{r}
# same slope, but varying intercept
mod1 <- glm(bonus_frac ~ bps + team, data = mdt, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
summary(mod1)
anova(mod0, mod1, test = "Chisq")

mod1_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod1, type = "response"))
mdt <- joinModelDt(mdt, mod1_fits)

# view for 2 of the teams
ggplot(mdt[team %in% c("Arsenal", "Burnley"),], aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac, col = team)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height= 0.025) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi, fill = team), colour=NA, alpha = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu))
```

Can see there are significant effects for a varying intersect by team.
A positive change in a team coefficient is interpreted to mean that for the 
same bps value, the probability of receiving bonus points increases. What's interesting
about comparing Arsenal to Burnley is that they finished in positions 6 and 7 respectively,
yet have constrasting data. Arsenal scored 74 and conceded 51 goals whilst Burnley 
scored 36 and conceded 39. Therefore, Burnley were involved in a lot more low goal scoring
matches. As we've seen, this would lower the amount of bps on average, thus lowering
the amount required to receive bonus points.  

Added a chi-squared test to see if its significant in reduction of residual variance,
which it is. Lets add in a random slope:


```{r}
# random slope and intercept
mod2 <- glm(bonus_frac ~ bps*team, data = mdt, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
summary(mod2)
anova(mod1, mod2, test = "Chisq")

# significant, so will re-assign mod1
mod1 <- mod2
mod2 <- NULL

# extract p values and coefficients. plot deviation from main team: "Arsenal"
find_i <- grepl("(?<!:)team", names(coef(mod1)), perl = TRUE)
i_coefs <- coef(mod1)[find_i]
i_pvals <- coef(summary(mod1))[,4][find_i] 
find_s <- grepl("(?<=:)team", names(coef(mod1)), perl = TRUE)
s_coefs <- coef(mod1)[find_s]
s_pvals <- coef(summary(mod1))[,4][find_s] 
team_coefs <- data.table(team = gsub("team", "", names(i_coefs)),
                         intercept = i_coefs,
                         slope = s_coefs,
                         pval_i = i_pvals,
                         pval_s = s_pvals)
team_coefs[]

# see how slope and intercept change, by team. Not all are significant
ggplot(team_coefs, aes(x = intercept, y = slope, label = team)) + 
  geom_text_repel() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)

mod1_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod1, type = "response"))
mdt <- joinModelDt(mdt, mod1_fits)

# view for 2 of the teams
ggplot(mdt[team %in% c("Arsenal", "Burnley"),], aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac, col = team)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height= 0.025) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi, fill = team), colour=NA, alpha = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu))
```

Arsenal is the baseline here. A positive change in the slope parameter means that
the gradient of the slope is much steeper. For each value change in bps, 
our probability of receiving bonus points increases.

Man Utd and West Brom points on the intercept v slope change graph are the most
unusual, due to their overall league performance.

```{r}
ggplot(mdt[team %in% c("West Brom", "Man Utd"),], aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac, col = team)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height= 0.025) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi, fill = team), colour=NA, alpha = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu))
```


Overall impact, by team
```{r, fig.height = 12}
mod1_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod1, type = "response"))
mdt <- joinModelDt(mdt, mod1_fits)

ggplot(mdt, aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height= 0.025, col = "darkgrey") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi), fill = "orange", colour=NA, alpha = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit)) + 
  facet_wrap(~team, ncol = 4) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu))
```

#### Opposition Team
Lets look at the opposing team now. Is the threshold lower depending on who you are playing?

```{r}
mod2 <- glm(bonus_frac ~ bps + opponent_team, 
            data = mdt, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
summary(mod2)
anova(mod0, mod2, test = "Chisq")

mod2_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod2, type = "response"))
mdt <- joinModelDt(mdt, mod2_fits)

select_teams <- c("Man City", "Burnley")
smdt <- mdt[opponent_team %in% select_teams,]

ggplot(smdt, aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac, col = opponent_team)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height= 0.025) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi, fill = opponent_team), colour=NA, alpha = .2) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu))
```

There aren't many significant effects here. However, bear in mind that if the 
main level changed from Arsenal to Burnley, there would be more significant effects,
as the hypothesis is testing whether the intercept changes against the main level.

In addition, there are much fewer observations for players who scored bonus points 
against Man City because of how well they did (see below). This is verified with
them possessing the lowest intercept estimate in the model.

```{r}
sum_dt <- dt[, .(bonus = sum(bonus)), by = team]
  ggplot(sum_dt, aes(x = reorder(team, bonus), y = bonus)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(y = bonus), fill = "orange") +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    ylab("Team") + 
    xlab("Overall bonus points") 
```

#### Playing Position
We can also look at the impact of position on bonus points. People in different
positions may do well based on differing circumstance, and may correlate with 
the performance of players in other positions. 

We can check this by looking at whether certain positions score together (below).
In this case I took all fixtures where Goalkeepers received a bonus point. The mosaic plots
below show that when they score, defenders often score too, way more than for fixtures
where Goalkeepers don't score.  

```{r}
gkp_fixtures <- dt[bonus > 0 & position == "GKP", fixture]
fdt <- dt[fixture %in% gkp_fixtures & bonus > 0 & position != "GKP",]
odt <- dt[!fixture %in% gkp_fixtures & bonus > 0,]
plot(table(fdt$position, fdt$bonus), main = "bonus distribution (GKP receives bonus)",
     col = "cadetblue1")
plot(table(odt$position, odt$bonus), main = "bonus distribution (GKP doesn't receives bonus)",
     col = "orange")
```

Lets look at how position affects our base model:

```{r}
mod3 <- glm(bonus_frac ~ bps*position, 
            data = mdt, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
summary(mod3)
# compare to base
anova(mod0, mod3, test = "Chisq")

mod3_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod3, type = "response"))
mdt <- joinModelDt(mdt, mod3_fits)

ggplot(mdt, aes(x = bps, y = bonus_frac)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = bps, ymin = pi.low, ymax = pi.hi, fill = position), colour=NA, alpha = .2) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = bps, y = fit, col = position)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(ql, qu)) 
```

All effects are significant, for both the slope and intercept. 

When keepers do well the probability of receiving bonus points has a steeper inclination. Often when
keepers do really well, they keep a clean sheet and make lots of saves. If a team
dominates a match, it increases likelihood of a clean sheet, but reduces the number of saves required.
Therefore, we would presume if a keeper has a clean sheet and lots of saves, then
the attacking side of the team has not been brilliant, increasing the bonus points chances.


#### Final Model
Bringing it all together in to one model:
```{r}
mod4 <- glm(bonus_frac ~ bps*position + bps*team + opponent_team, 
            data = mdt, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
summary(mod4)

# performance is a lot better than for the base model with only bps slope.
anova(mod0, mod4, test = "Chisq")

# performance isn't too much better than mod1, with the team effects.
# Parsimony could be measured by looking at a statistic that penalises model 
# complexity e.g. AIC.
anova(mod1, mod4, test = "Chisq")

# predict with main data
mod4_fits <- as.data.table(HH::interval(mod4, type = "response", newdata = dt))
dt <- joinModelDt(dt, mod4_fits)
dt[bps <= ql, fit := 0]

# residuals top and bottom
sum_dt <- dt[, .(bonus = sum(bonus),
                 fit = round(sum(fit*3), 1),
                 bps = sum(bps)), by = .(team, position, player_name)]
sum_dt[, residual := bonus - fit]
setorder(sum_dt, +residual)
head(sum_dt)
tail(sum_dt)

# plot the fits, by position, across the whole season
ggplot(sum_dt, aes(x = bonus, y = fit)) + 
geom_point(col = "darkgrey") + 
geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
theme_minimal() + 
facet_wrap(~position)
```


## Final Thoughts

In this post I've been practicing visualising patterns in the fpl bonus point data
for different teams and positions. Logistic regression for a quasibinomial distribution
was used to generate the predictions and analyse different variables. 

An extension of this would be to try to focus on the interaction between players 
within their own teams, by creating new variables e.g. we saw that Goalkeepers and
Defenders often score together. The effect of playing at Home could be added to the analysis too.

It may be possible to cluster fixtures together based on the score, and treat this 
as a categorical variable in the model. I strayed away from using any data that 
would interact with the bps variable though, as its dependent on the number of 
goals scored. 

I haven't focussed in on specific players during this, and there are other 
interesting views that could be explored e.g. player form, and patterns in 
transfer behaviour.

We have the core data that make up the bps final score. It would be more 
complicated to do so, but we could model the individual event distributions e.g.
probability of scoring a goal, and try to predict these events to estimate bps 
for future fixtures. We would run in to situations with sparse data e.g. there
are only 17 red cards in the data set.
